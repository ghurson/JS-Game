# Example JS Game

## Trying to teach myself the basics of OOP JS

The RPG game will feature one or more characters doing text-based battle.

### Roadmap

+ Character Setup
  + Forms With Names
  + Setting Stats Somehow
+ Combat with more than one enemy
  + Choose which enemy is attacked
  + Free-for-all and Teams
+ Canvas Migration
  + I have no idea what that means.
